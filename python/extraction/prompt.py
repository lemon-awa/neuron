SYSTEM_PROMPT_LIST_CELL_TYPES = """
You are a neurobiologist specializing in Drosophila connectomics. You are examining a scientific paper on the connectome of Drosophila (fruit flies) to identify any terms that appear to refer to neuronal cell types, regardless of certainty about function or specificity.

Instructions:
- Identify all terms that resemble neuronal cell types. Short combinations of letters and numbers often represent neuronal cell types and may include symbols (like "+") for multi-glomerular types.
- Avoid general or broad English terms such as "general sensory neuron" or "broadly tuned PN."
- If no neuronal cell types are found, return "None".
- Use the full name of the cell type. e.g. "VP1d RN" rather than "VP1d" if VP1d RN appears as a whole word in the text.
- The term must be *singular* rather than plural. e.g. "VP1d RN" rather than "VP1d RNs".
- Do NOT add any irrelevant chars like bullet points.
- If there are abbreviations, use the abbreviation. e.g. VP1d PN rather than VP1d projection neuron.

Format:
- Output a list of each identified term on a new line.
- Do not include any other text in your response.

These results are consistent with reports of three to four pairs of aristal sensory neurons that project to VP2 (heating) and VP3 (cooling) [15, 16] and an unknown number of non-aristal sensory neurons supplying the slow-cool VP3 PN [27].

VP3 PN

Input:
NBLAST clustering supported six distinct classes of unilateral RNs: VP1d, VP1l, VP1m, VP2, VP3, and VP5 (Figure S2A).

Output:
VP1d RN
VP1l RN
VP1m RN
VP2 RN
VP3 RN
VP5 RN

Input:
To our surprise, unilateral RN axons in the predicted location of VP1 formed not one, but three distinct populations. These defined adjacent glomeruli (Figure 1B') that we designated according to their relative positions: VP1d, VP1l, and VP1m (Figures 1C–1E). NBLAST clustering supported six distinct classes of unilateral RNs: VP1d, VP1l, VP1m, VP2, VP3, and VP5 (Figure S2A). VP1d RNs most closely resembled the Ir40a-positive ''VP1'' neurons in morphology and location.

Output:
VP1d RN
VP1l RN
VP1m RN
VP2 RN
VP3 RN
VP5 RN
VP1

Input:
Next, we used trans-Tango to trace putative postsynaptic targets of APN2 (24C06-GAL4; Figure 7B). This labeled WPN-like processes, which can be identified most clearly where the dorsal axon exiting the wedge sends a major branch into the posterior lateral protocerebrum (Figure 7B, inset). APN2>trans-Tango also labeled the same two commissures as in the JO-CE trans-Tango, however we believe this labeling arises from a cluster of small cell bodies near the B1 cell bodies that are also labeled in 24C06-GAL4 (Video S2). In contrast, APN3>trans-Tango did not appear to label WPNs. Some diffuse labeling was present along the region that runs between the WED and the posterior lateral protocerebrum (PLP), but these processes were much more anterior than the WPN axon tract between these structures (Figure 7C, Video S3). These results support our conclusions from silencing and optogenetic activation (Figure 6 and Figure S6), that APN3 neurons may connect only indirectly to WPNs. APN3>trans-Tango did label many putative second-order mechanosensory neurons, including APN2, B1, AMMC-Db1, and at least one other commissure (Figure 7, Video S3). This diversity of putative downstream partners suggests that APN3 broadly interconnects mechanosensory circuitry. Finally, we analyzed the trans-Tango signal driven by B1 neurons. B1>trans-Tango labeled distinct WPN-like processes at the posterior face of the brain and the corresponding cell body cluster (Figure 7D), consistent with the hypothesis that B1 neurons provide input to WPNs. We observed no labeling of APN2 or APN3 in B1>trans-Tango.

Output:
APN2
B1
WPN
APN3
AMMC-Db1

Related paragraphs: In Drosophila, VPNs that have dendrites in the optic lobe and axon terminals in the central brain detect ethologically relevant visual features, such as small-object motion or looming of dark objects, and are close to the sensorimotor interface. Multiple VPN types initiate visually guided behaviours, and some VPN types synapse directly onto a subset of the ≈500 premotor descending neurons (DNs) per hemibrain whose activation drives distinct motor actions. There are 20–30 different types of VPN, each a population of 20–200 neurons per hemibrain (Fig. 1a), with small receptive fields (20–40°) that together cover visual space. VPN dendrites in the optic lobe thus form a topographic map of visual space, and object location on the fly’s retina is theoretically encoded by which VPN neurons within a given type are excited. However, it has been unclear whether, and how, this spatial information is passed to downstream partners because the axons of all VPNs within a given type terminate in narrow, distinct glomeruli within the central brain (Fig. 1a) with little or no observable topography at the light-microscopy level. Yet several VPN cell types have been associated with direction-specific behaviours, including backing up and turning, escaping looming stimuli from different directions, collision avoidance and, in flight, saccade turns away from a visual stimulus. Here we examine how direction-specific visual information is transformed onto downstream premotor networks by exploring the VPN-to-postsynaptic partner interface using electron microscopy (EM), light microscopy, physiology and behaviour.
Candidate cell type: VPN

Output:
false
VPN refers to a broad class of visual neurons, not a specific enough cell type.

Title: Encoding of wind direction by central neurons in Drosophila
Abstract: Wind is a major navigational cue for insects, but how wind direction is decoded by central neurons in the insect brain is unknown. Here we find that walking flies combine signals from both antennae to orient to wind during olfactory search behavior. Movements of single antennae are ambiguous with respect to wind direction, but the difference between left and right antennal displacements yields a linear code for wind direction in azimuth. Second-order mechanosensory neurons share the ambiguous responses of a single antenna and receive input primarily from the ipsilateral antenna. Finally, we identify novel "wedge projection neurons" that integrate signals across the two antennae and receive input from at least three classes of second-order neurons to produce a more linear representation of wind direction. This study establishes how a feature of the sensory environment-wind direction-is decoded by neurons that compare information across two sensors.
Related paragraphs: We next sought to characterize how antennal movements are represented by neurons in the central brain. First, we investigated the tuning of AMMC projection neurons APN2 and APN3, which are thought to be downstream of the wind-sensitive CE JONs. We presented 4 s tonic wind stimuli from five directions using the same apparatus described above (also see Figure 2). We found that APN2 neurons were tonically inhibited by wind from all directions except the ipsilateral side (Figures 3B–D). APN2 neurons were non-spiking and responded to tonic wind with graded changes in membrane potential and little adaptation (Figures 3B–D). All APN2 cells we recorded were least inhibited by ipsilateral wind, although we observed some variation in the amount of inhibition across cells (Figure 3D). The tuning curves for APN2 neurons had a hooked shape (Figure 3D) much like the tuning curve for ipsilateral antennal displacement.

APN2 are AMMC projection neurons.
APN2 are thought to be downstream of the wind-sensitive CE JONs.

Related paragraphs: What other neurons might provide input to WPNs? One compelling candidate are the B1 neurons. These AMMC projection neurons receive input from the antenna ipsilateral to their cell bodies, and project both ipsilaterally and contralaterally. They have been thought to be mostly auditory, based on their anatomical position downstream of the sound-sensitive A/B JONs, and the finding that silencing them significantly impairs courtship song responses in females. However, a recent study showed that these neurons respond directionally to displacements of the antenna induced by a piezoelectric probe, and that a subset of these are tuned for low frequencies, suggesting a possible role in wind direction encoding. To test the hypothesis that B1 neurons contribute to WPN directional responses, we silenced B1 neurons, and recorded wind responses in WPNs. We found that this resulted in a diminished WPN wind response (Figures 6F–H).

B1 might provide input to WPNs.
